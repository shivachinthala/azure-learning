# azure ARM templates (IAC)

# The Azure ARM templates are JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project.

# These are used to automate the deployment and management of resources in Azure

# Key features of ARM templates include:
Declarative Syntax: You define the desired state of your infrastructure rather than writing imperative scripts.

Resource Group Support: ARM templates deploy resources in resource groups, enabling easy management and organization.

Idempotency: Running the same template multiple times results in the same resource state, preventing duplication or inconsistent states.

Dependencies: You can define dependencies between resources, ensuring they are created in the correct order.

Modularity and Reusability: ARM templates can be nested and linked, promoting modularity and reuse of code.

Parameterization: Parameters allow you to customize deployments without modifying the template, making it more flexible and reusable.

Extensibility: Custom scripts and extensions can be included to perform additional configuration or setup tasks during deployment.

# An ARM template is composed of several sections:
Schema: Specifies the version of the ARM template language.

Content Version: A user-defined version number for the template.

Parameters: Input values that can be provided during deployment to customize resource configurations.

Variables: Values that are computed within the template to simplify complex expressions.

Resources: The core section where you define the resources to be deployed.

Outputs: Values that are returned after the deployment, often used for debugging or providing information to other processes.
